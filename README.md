# ChessSiteSpring
This is my final project for my AP Computer Science class.
Backend is in Java, using Spring Boot, Spring Boot MVC, Maven to compile, JDBC for database querying, and Postgresql.
It is hosted on a personal web server running nginx on ubuntu 18.04.

This is a chess game where you can play and save your games using unique id's for each game. You can retrieve games with past id's also and continue playing.

The front end is html/css/js with vanilla js except for jquery for ajax and a couple other things.
